# 📝 React - To Do List

## 🔖 Description

This repo is for educational purposes only.

We will be learning how to build a To Do List using React. This primarily focuses on the use of React hooks such as `useState`, `useReducer`, and `useEffect`. If time permits, we can go into `createContext` and `useContext`.

In this repo, I have created mock endpoints. They do not actually hit a server, but I tried my best to mimic the actions. The purpose of this is just to practice building an application that does hit a server.


## 🚧 Acceptance Criteria

1. As a user, I can create an item on my to-do list.
2. As a user, I can delete an item on my to-do list.
3. As a user, on first page load, I see my previously saved items.
4. As a user, when the page is loading, I see a loading scrren

### ⭐️ Extra Credit

1. As a user, I can markup an item as complete and it will disappear from my list.
2. As a user, I can see all my completed items in a separate list.
